RESPONSIVE PORTFOLIO Assignment #2

The assignment was to create 3 pages, each linked to the others, as an initial classwork portfolio.  We were given images to try to re-create a similar look.  We were also encouraged to use Bootstrap as much as possible.

I created the repo under the title "Initial Commit" on 7/2

Later that day, I began with portfolio.html, using the Bootstrap Starter Template to create the structure of the Navbar and the page, so that each subsequent page would look similar in appearance.

The same day, I used the portfolio.html to create the structure of index.html and contact.html

I continued working on 7/5, tweaking aspects of each .html file, most notably the images on the portfolio.html page.  I sent 2 commits to the repo on this date, each with small tweaks to the code to improve the overall aesthetic of the pages.

Today, 7/8, I made some final adjustments to the .html, most notably adding rows and columns in an attempt to replicate the example images provided.

I struggled on this project with getting the "About, Contact, Portfolio" to appear as a second row below the Navbar button with my name at the smallest breakpoint.  I created navbar.html to play with various templates from Bootstrap to replicate the navber as it appears in the assignment.  I was ultimately not successful.  

I did come across a template on Bootstrap (Pricing Template - "template.html") which DOES replicate the format from the images, but ultimately I decided to submit the files I was able to create on my own.  Above all, I understand that this is a work in progress, and that my skills will improve.
